## Trousseau contributing
A open source project without the open source communities is a bit like a chocolate cookies without chocolate; the best is missing!

So Check out the Trousseau project website and [Git repo](https://github.com/Trousseau-io/trousseau) and do not be afraid to contribute by picking up an issue or propose ideas, features, code. We will review these together via a proposed pull request and merge for the greater good.
If you need a bit more information on how to contribute to a project, the [following link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) will provide you a good starting point.

## Instant Messaging 
Currently thinking about using either Discord or Slack to provide a instant messaging platform. News to follow soon.

## Community Meeting
Todo when the project will reach a MVP2 stade or a good amount of contributors.
